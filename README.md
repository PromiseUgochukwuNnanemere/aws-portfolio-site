# 🌐 AWS Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built with HTML and CSS and hosted on **Amazon S3** with a custom domain managed via **Namecheap**. The project demonstrates how to host a secure, globally distributed static site using **AWS CloudFront** and **ACM (SSL)**.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### 1. ✅ Amazon S3 Bucket
- Created S3 bucket named `myawscloudprojects.site`
- Enabled static website hosting
- Uploaded `index.html` and `index.css`
- Configured index document and error document

### 2. 🔒 Permissions & Security
- Disabled public access block
- Added custom bucket policy to allow CloudFront access
- Used CloudFront **Origin Access Control (OAC)** instead of public access

### 3. 🌍 Domain Routing with Namecheap
- Set up **Custom DNS**
- Added AWS name servers to Namecheap dashboard
- Managed DNS routing via Route 53 hosted zone

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Add CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or CodePipeline
- Enable CloudFront access logs for better observability of S3 and CloudFront
- Use Route 53 for DNS
- Convert into a CI/CD pipeline using CodePipeline
